**The ZLA Toolbox (Opt-In Architecture):**
- **Default Behavior:** ALWAYS default to standard, pragmatic engineering stacks. If a project requires a backend, a local database, or server-side APIs, build it without hesitation. 
- **ZLA Definition:** Zero-Liability Architecture (ZLA) strictly denotes a 100% client-side, backend-free, static web application.
- **When to Apply ZLA:** ONLY enforce ZLA constraints if the user EXPLICITLY requests it for the current project (e.g., "Let's build this as a ZLA app"). 
- **Marketing Context:** When ZLA *is* deployed, retain the name to establish authority (e.g., "Because it's ZLA, your server bill is $0 and you can't be hacked").

**Cloudflare Deployment Workflow:**
For ALL Cloudflare projects (Workers, Pages, or hybrid), NEVER run `wrangler deploy` or `npx wrangler deploy` directly to deploy frontend or full-stack apps.
The ONLY correct deployment workflow is:
1. `git add`
2. `git commit`
3. `git push origin main` (or the appropriate branch)

Cloudflare CI automatically builds and deploys on every push. Direct wrangler deploys bypass CI, skip the build pipeline, and cause version mismatches between what GitHub has and what is live.

*Exception*: If the project directory lacks a configured git remote repository (e.g., `git remote -v` returns no origin), the agent is permitted to execute `npx wrangler deploy` locally to update the service.

**Mandatory `agy-mcp-server` Sidecar Execution Invariant:**
From this moment forward, ALL terminal operations, DuckDB scripts, Python executions, and system actions across all skills, rules, and agents MUST be executed EXCLUSIVELY through `agy-mcp-server` (`exec_cmd`) or dedicated script files (`.py`/`.ps1`). 
- Raw inline subshell commands via `run_command` (`pwsh.exe -c "..."`) are STRICTLY BANNED.
- All command parameters must be passed as structured argument arrays to prevent string-escaping bugs and unclosed subshell hangs.
</RULE[AGENTS.md]>

<RULE[AGENTS.md]>
**Pre-Flight Command Verification & DuckDB Cross-Referencing Invariant:**
Before invoking `run_command` to execute complex Python scripts or terminal operations, the agent MUST:
1. Verify exact database schemas and column names via direct introspection or `db_session.py` before executing queries.
2. Cross-reference `agent_memory.transcripts` to reuse verified working command templates and parameter patterns.
3. Eliminate string-escaping trial-and-error by passing parameters via structured lists or validated script files rather than raw inline command strings.
</RULE[AGENTS.md]>

<RULE[AGENTS.md]>
**Command Failure Resolution (No Bandaids):**
If you, an Antigravity agent, run a command (e.g. via `run_command` or background tasks) and it FAILS, you MUST:
1. Immediately log the failure.
2. DO NOT move on or continue with subsequent steps.
3. Completely resolve the underlying failure to guarantee CORRECTNESS (do NOT use bandaid fixes or workarounds).
4. Verify the command succeeds before proceeding with the rest of your task.
This is non-negotiable and must be handled with utmost priority to prevent cascading errors and silent failures.
</RULE[AGENTS.md]>

<RULE[AGENTS.md]>
**Friction Elimination & Auto-Correction Invariant:**
- **Definition**: FRICTION occurs whenever the agent misinterprets operator intent, loops on broken patterns, or requires repeated corrections.
- **Mandatory Action**: FRICTION is strictly treated as a hard system configuration bug. The agent MUST:
  1. Immediately suspend current assumptions.
  2. Query DuckDB for historical context and past solutions via `db_session.py`.
  3. Execute sequential thinking (`sequentialthinking` MCP tool) to analyze the root cause step-by-step.
  4. Propose or apply permanent rule/skill updates (`/learn`) so the failure mode can NEVER recur.

<RULE[AGENTS.md]>
**NTFS Single-Source-of-Truth Hard-Link Invariant:**
Whenever initializing, updating, or maintaining system-wide configuration files (`AGENTS.md`, `.agentsignore`, `db_session.py`), the agent MUST enforce single-source-of-truth storage at `C:\Users\John\.gemini\config\` and maintain NTFS hard links (`os.link`) to all workspace target directories. Never create isolated copy duplicates of system configuration files.
